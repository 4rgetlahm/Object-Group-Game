**Current objective:**
Make a Windows Forms application, in which the user can see its player's values
and an inventory of collected items. Additionally, a map in which the user can see
surrounding locations from a database.

1. Add more functionality to backend
	- Add functionality to eventually read the location and item database
	- Add functionality for GUI to get player and inventory information
	- Add functionality to save and load user database (collected and equipped (to-be implemented) items)
2. Add graphical UI
	- Create main window
	- Create panels
3. Create demonstrational database of locations and items
	- Add few iconic places to database. For example: Gedimino bokštas,
		Vilniaus Katedra, Šv. Onos bažnyčia
	- Create items that will be received when visiting those places
		- Names
		- Status effects
